# Pharmaceutical Spending Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes pharmaceutical spending data obtained from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The main objective is to explore global spending trends, investigate relationships among spending variables, and prepare the dataset for advanced analytics and modeling.

## Data Sources

The data is derived from the following sources:

- **Pharmaceutical Spending Data**: OECD  
- **Population Data**: DataHub  

### Data Fields

## Preprocessing Steps

### Data Loading
- The raw dataset is loaded and saved for reference.

### Data Cleaning
- Missing values in the `FLAG_CODES` column are replaced with "Unknown".
- Data types are standardized for consistency.

### Data Transformation
- Growth rates for `TOTAL_SPEND` and `USD_CAP` are calculated for time-series analysis.
- Outliers in `TOTAL_SPEND` are identified and removed based on Z-scores.

### Data Saving
- The processed dataset is saved in the `data/processed` directory for further analysis.

## Exploratory Analysis

### Pairwise Relationships
A pairplot was used to visualize relationships among the variables. Key observations:
- **Positive correlations** between:
  - `TIME` and `TOTAL_SPEND` (indicating increasing spending over time).
  - `PC_GDP` and `TOTAL_SPEND` (countries with higher GDP allocation to health tend to spend more).
- **Weak correlation** between `PC_HEALTHXP` and `USD_CAP`.

---

## Scatterplot Analyses

### 1. TIME vs. TOTAL_SPEND
- **Observation**: A clear upward trend in `TOTAL_SPEND` over time, indicating global increases in pharmaceutical spending.
- **Insights**:
  - The linear regression model fits well for lower spending values but struggles with outliers at the higher end.
  - Spending appears to grow non-linearly over time.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Use polynomial regression or log transformations to better capture non-linear growth patterns.
- **Visualization**:

### 2. PC_HEALTHXP vs. USD_CAP
- **Observation**: A weak positive correlation exists between the percentage of health spending and per capita spending.
- **Insights**:
  - Higher `PC_HEALTHXP` values slightly increase `USD_CAP`, but the variance is large.
  - Other factors likely influence per capita spending significantly.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Group countries by income or healthcare system type to explore stronger relationships.
  - Perform feature engineering to introduce new explanatory variables.
- **Visualization**:

### 3. PC_GDP vs. TOTAL_SPEND
- **Observation**: A positive correlation is evident, with higher GDP allocation to health linked to increased pharmaceutical spending.
- **Insights**:
  - Outliers with extremely high `TOTAL_SPEND` values skew the linear regression line.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Investigate outliers to identify specific countries driving this trend.
  - Consider normalizing `TOTAL_SPEND` by population to improve comparability.
- **Visualization**:

### 4. Pairplot Summary
- **Trends**:
  - Strong correlations between `TIME` and `TOTAL_SPEND`.
  - Moderate correlation between `PC_GDP` and `TOTAL_SPEND`.
- **Outliers**:
  - Significant outliers in `TOTAL_SPEND` and `USD_CAP` influence trends.
  - Removing outliers helps reveal clearer relationships.
